# Expandable list of things to back up.
backup-list:
  # The backup list is comprised of three things:
  #   - folder names
  #   - file name formats
  #   - whether this plugin should create the backup
  # The file name format is what the backup's naming scheme is
  # For more information about timedate formatting, see
  #   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
  # To verify they are being formatted correctly, do /drivebackup list
  # Correct formatting is important, as this is how the plugin knows
  #   which backup is the most recent!
  #
  # For example, if you wanted to back up crash reports, you would do:
  #  crash-reports:
  #    format: "'crash-'yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss'-server.zip'"
  #    create: true
  # The 'crash-reports:' part refers to the folder, and the "'crash-'yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss'-server.txt'" refers to
  #   what format the file name is. Since create is set to true, the plugin will take the crash-reports folder,
  #   zip it into a file according to the format, and upload it.
  # You can also use the blacklist key to not include specified files
  #    blacklist:
  #    - "dontbackup"
  #    - "thesefolders"
  #    - "orthisfile.txt"
